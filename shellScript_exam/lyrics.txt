Lullaby of Birdland, that's what I 
Always hear when you sigh
Never in my wordland 
Could there be ways to reveal
In a phrase how I feel
Have you ever heard two turtle doves
Bill and coo when they love?
That's the kind of magic 
Music we make with our lips when we kiss
And there's a weepy old willow
He really knows how to cry
That's how I'd cry in my pillow
If you should tell me farewell and goodbye
Lullaby of Birdland whisper low
Kiss me sweet and we'll go
Flyin' high in Birdland
High in the sky up above
All because we're in love

You'd be so nice to come home to
You'd be so nice by the fire
While the breeze on high, sang a lullaby
You'd be all my heart could desire
Under stars chilled by the winter
Under an August moon shining above
You'd be so nice, you'd be paradise
To come home to and love
Under stars chilled by the winter
Under an August moon burning above
You'd be so nice, you'd be paradise
To come home to and love

What is this thing called love?
This funny thing called love?
Just who can solve its mystery?
Why should it make a fool of me?
I saw you there one wonderful day
You took my heart and threw it away
That's why I ask the lord in heaven above
What is this thing called love?
I saw you there one wonderful day
You took my heart and threw it away
That's why I ask the lord in heaven above
What is this thing called love?

Sing low, sing clear
Sweet words in my ear
Not a whisper of despair
But love's own prayer
Sing on, until
You bring back the thrill
Of a sentimental tune
That died too soon
Our harmony was lost
But you forgave, I forgot
Whisper not of quarrels past
You know we've had our last
So now, we'll be
On key constantly
Love will whisper on eternally
Why did we listen when they said it wouldn't last
Gossiping voices made us break up, but you know we still can make up
If we forget 'em all, and answer Cupid's call
It's the truth!
Whispers of troubles are an echo of the past
All it will take to lose my gloom is just a whisper not of rumours
But of your love for me
That's how it's got to be
